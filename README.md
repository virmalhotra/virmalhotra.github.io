# Project Name: The Clothing Chronicle
# Project Description: The project exists to bring to the world a short film I made on doing my laundry. It represents my struggles as a freshman, and the general process of adulting
# Process: As I joined the class a week late, I had a lot to do to catch up. With the help of my friends, I was able to film myself and edited the video on Canva. After that the website building process started, and hours of tutorials and a lot of coffee later, the final product was ready.
# Reflection: Building a website made me realise how impressive the websites we use in our daily lives actually are. I would have wanted to do a bit better, but I am proud of what I was able to accomplish.
