                    It was an average sunny Abu Dhabi morning. I woke up and opened my email like any other day, and I found that I had edit-swapped into Communications Lab, the course I
                    most loved, the course I most desired. I asked some people, "What have I missed? What do I need to do?".
                    "Make a short film", they said, making me wonder whether I placed into the correct course.
                    I double checked, and I was, indeed, in the correct course. That meant my first IM assignment would be making a film. I looked around my room, searching for inspiration.
                    And that's when the smell hit me. The smell of dirty clothes.
                
                    I looked at my screen...
                    I looked at the clothes...
                    And I decided to kill two birds with one stone.
                
                    The outcome, was this video.
